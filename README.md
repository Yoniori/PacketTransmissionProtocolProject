📦 Packet Transmission Protocol

This project simulates a basic packet-based communication system between two endpoints – a Sender and a Receiver – using a simplified, custom transmission protocol.

⸻

👨‍💻 Project Structure

The core of the project includes the following classes:
	•	Packet – Represents a data packet containing source/destination addresses, a sequence number, ACK flag, and payload data.
	•	Communicator – A base class for both sender and receiver, holding shared attributes like address and sequence handling.
	•	Sender – Splits messages into packets, assigns sequence numbers, and sends them.
	•	Receiver – Receives packets, stores them, and returns acknowledgments (ACKs).

⸻

📌 Key Features
	•	Splits long messages into fixed-size packets (default: 3 characters).
	•	Tracks each packet using sequence numbers.
	•	Handles acknowledgment (ACK) packets for confirming successful delivery.
	•	Simulates packet sending/receiving and prints status updates to the console.

🧪 Example Usage

sender = Sender(address="192.168.1.1", num_letters_in_packet=3)
receiver = Receiver(address="192.168.1.2")

packets = sender.prepare_packets("HelloWorld", destination_address=receiver.get_address())

for packet in packets:
    sent_packet = sender.send_packet(packet)
    receiver.receive_packet(sent_packet)
    ack = Packet(receiver.get_address(), sender.get_address(), packet.get_sequence_number(), is_ack=True)
    sender.receive_ack(ack)

🚀 Future Enhancements
	•	Introduce random transmission errors and implement retransmission logic.
	•	Add support for more advanced protocols like Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat.
	•	Create a simple command-line or graphical interface for running simulations.
	•	Export transmission logs to file.
